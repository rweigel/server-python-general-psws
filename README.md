# Development

Assumes magnetometer data in directories as under `data/` - each subdir corresponds to data from a station with ID in `catalog.csv`.

The responses to HAPI endpoints are implemented as Python scripts that return the response to `stdout`.

Return response to `/hapi/catalog` request

```
python bin/catalog.py
```

Return response to `/hapi/info` request

```
python bin/info.py S000028
```

Return response to `/hapi/data` request

```
python bin/data.py W2NAF 2025-10-20 2025-10-21
```
